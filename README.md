# AI-Powered-Urban-Planner-Assistant
The AI-Powered Urban Planner Assistant is a data-driven tool designed to optimize city planning by analyzing land use, traffic congestion, and environmental impact. 
Using machine learning, it predicts optimal zoning, assesses traffic flow, and evaluates sustainability factors like pollution and green space availability.

The system integrates data from sources like OpenStreetMap, Google Maps API, and environmental databases to provide real-time and predictive insights. Built with Flask (backend), React.js (frontend), and Leaflet.js (for maps), it enables urban planners to make informed decisions for sustainable and efficient city development. Key Features:

Land-Use Prediction (using Random Forest) Traffic Congestion Analysis Environmental Impact Assessment Interactive 2D Map Visualization Data Export & Reporting
